# OpenStudentNetworks
This repository contains code and an example notebook of how to model student results in networks of courses (courses taken by partly overlapping student populations).

## Packages and environment
To be added.


## Open Data and your own data
It is based on data that is [publicly available from the Open Univeristy](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset), but has also been extensively tested on data from the University of Amsterdam, with very similar results. The code base assumes that data for the example notebook is in a data folder in the main directory of the repository. Make sure to put there like suggested by the example notebook. It should also be clear how to work with your own data.
