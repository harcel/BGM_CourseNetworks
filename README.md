# OpenStudentNetworks
This repository contains code and an example notebook of how to model student results in networks of courses (courses taken by partly overlapping student populations).

It is based on data that is [publicly available from the Open Univeristy](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset), but has also been extensively tested on data from the University of Amsterdam, with very similar results.
